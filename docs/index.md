# Arc Kit Documentation

Welcome to Arc Kit - the Adaptive Reasoning Chains Toolkit for next-generation software development.

## Quick Start

## Core Concepts

**Adaptive Reasoning Chains (ARC)** represent a fundamental shift from static specification-driven development to systems that evolve intelligently with changing requirements, context, and feedback.

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware Reasoning**: Systems understand and adapt to changing contexts
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Specifications evolve based on feedback
- **Predictive Validation**: Identifies issues before they occur
- **Self-Improving**: Learns from each project for enhanced development
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Reasoning chains across multiple AI agents
