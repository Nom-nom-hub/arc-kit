# [ADAPTIVE CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this adaptive checklist covers]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md or relevant adaptive documentation]

**Note**: This adaptive checklist is generated by the `/arckit.checklist` command based on feature context and adaptive requirements.

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The adaptive checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.

  The /arckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual adaptive items based on:
  - User's specific adaptive checklist request
  - Adaptive feature requirements from spec.md
  - Adaptive technical context from plan.md
  - Adaptive implementation details from tasks.md
  - Context awareness and adaptation effectiveness requirements

  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated adaptive checklist file.
