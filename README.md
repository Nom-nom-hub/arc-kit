# Arc Kit - Adaptive Reasoning Chains Toolkit

Arc Kit provides a practical framework for software development with **Adaptive Reasoning Chains (ARC)**, combining iterative development with adaptive planning. This methodology enables teams to create software that can evolve with changing requirements while maintaining high quality and clear documentation.

## 🚀 Installation

Install Arc Kit directly from the GitHub repository using uv:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/arc-kit.git
```

## 🚀 The ARC Approach: Adaptive Reasoning Chains

While traditional methodologies create rigid specifications, Arc Kit provides **Adaptive Reasoning Chains** - a practical methodology where specifications, architectures, and implementations can evolve based on feedback, changing requirements, and implementation learnings.

### Key Benefits

1. **Iterative Refinement**: Specifications evolve based on real feedback and implementation learnings
2. **Clear Reasoning**: All decisions are documented with clear reasoning chains
3. **Adaptive Planning**: Development plans adjust to new information and challenges
4. **Practical Implementation**: Focused on actionable steps and real-world applicability
5. **Collaborative Development**: Facilitates both human teams and human-AI collaboration

## 📋 Core Commands

Arc Kit provides 9 commands following the adaptive reasoning chain methodology:

### Core Workflow Commands

- `/arckit.constitution` - Establish project principles and development guidelines
- `/arckit.define` - Define what needs to be built with clear requirements
- `/arckit.plan` - Plan how to build it with implementation approach
- `/arckit.tasks` - Generate detailed implementation tasks from your plan
- `/arckit.implement` - Execute the implementation with testing and validation

### Enhancement Commands

- `/arckit.analyze` - Analyze specifications and plans for consistency and quality
- `/arckit.clarify` - Clarify underspecified areas in requirements
- `/arckit.checklist` - Generate custom quality checklists for validation
- `/arckit.taskstoissues` - Convert tasks to issue tracking items

## 🎯 Adaptive Reasoning Chain Process

The ARC methodology follows an iterative process:

1. **Specification** → Create initial specifications that can evolve
2. **Analysis** → Assess technical feasibility and identify risks
3. **Design** → Create adaptable architecture and components
4. **Planning** → Develop implementation plan with adaptation strategies
5. **Implementation** → Execute with continuous learning and adaptation
6. **Validation** → Ensure quality and alignment with requirements

## 🤝 Comparison with Traditional Approaches

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | Arc Kit (Adaptive Reasoning Chains) |
|--------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Specifications | Rigid, static documents | Living, evolving specifications |
| Adaptability | Fixed requirements | Flexible adaptation to change |
| Evolution | Manual updates when needed | Iterative evolution based on feedback |
| Implementation | Theoretical focus | Practical, action-oriented |
| Collaboration | Human teams only | Human and AI collaboration |
| Documentation | Separate from code | Integrated reasoning chains |
